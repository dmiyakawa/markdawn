# Documentation System Setup

**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Type**: Setup  
**Status**: Complete ✅

## Objective
Establish comprehensive documentation system for AI-assisted development workflow as specified in project requirements.

## Documentation Files Created

### Core Project Documentation
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Primary guidance for Claude Code instances
  - Project overview and technology stack
  - AI-assisted development workflow
  - Build commands and quality standards
  - Project status and deployment targets

### AI Development Workflow Documentation (`ai/` directory)

#### `ai/architecture.md`
- Technology stack details and versions
- Project structure explanation
- Application architecture and data flow
- Build commands and quality standards
- Storage strategy and deployment targets

#### `ai/decisions.md`
- Technology selection rationale
- Architecture decisions with alternatives considered
- Rejected approaches with reasoning
- Quality assurance decisions
- Development workflow choices

#### `ai/tasks.md`
- Remaining high-priority tasks (markdown processing, WYSIWYG improvements)
- Medium-priority enhancements (UI improvements, editor features)
- Low-priority future considerations (advanced features, performance)
- Unresolved concerns and technical decisions needed

#### `ai/next_action.md`
- Current project status
- Immediate next steps for continuation
- Development commands ready to use
- Architecture decisions made

#### `ai/reminder.md`
- Code quality checklist (lint, format, test coverage)
- Documentation update requirements
- Development state verification
- Critical development reminders

### Log Organization Structure
Restructured logging from date-based to action-based:
```
ai/logs/
├── setup/          # Project setup and configuration
├── features/       # Feature implementations
└── fixes/         # Bug fixes and issue resolutions
```

## Benefits of Action-Based Logging
- **Better Organization**: Easy to find specific work by type
- **Improved Reference**: Developers can quickly locate relevant implementations
- **Clearer History**: Each log focuses on a specific accomplishment
- **Better Maintenance**: Easier to update and track progress on specific features

## Documentation Standards Established
- Each log includes objective, implementation details, and results
- Files contain clear status indicators (✅ Complete)
- Technical decisions are documented with rationale
- Next steps and limitations are clearly identified
