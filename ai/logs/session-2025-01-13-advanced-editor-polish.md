# Advanced Editor Polish Session - January 13, 2025

## Session Overview
Comprehensive implementation of high-priority advanced editor features, focusing on CodeMirror integration improvements, performance optimizations, and enhanced tab management capabilities.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Find/Replace CodeMirror Integration Fix
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: High
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/CodeMirrorEditor.vue`

**Problem**: Replace functionality was not working properly with CodeMirror's search system due to custom implementation conflicts.

**Solution**:
- Replaced custom search/replace logic with CodeMirror's native `SearchQuery` system
- Updated `performReplace()` and `performReplaceAll()` to use built-in `replaceNext()` and `replaceAll()` commands
- Enhanced `searchNext()` and `searchPrevious()` with proper search query setup
- Added search panel integration with `search({ top: true })`

**Impact**: Find/Replace functionality now works reliably with all options (regex, case-sensitive) and provides proper visual feedback.

### 2. Enhanced Undo/Redo System
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: High
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/CodeMirrorEditor.vue`
- `src/App.vue`

**Implementation**:
- Added proper event emission after undo/redo operations for UI state synchronization
- Increased history depth from 100 to 200 entries with faster grouping (300ms)
- Implemented `createHistoryBoundary()`, `performUndoWithBoundary()`, `performRedoWithBoundary()`
- Added `getHistoryStatus()` for comprehensive state reporting
- Enhanced history management methods

**Impact**: Professional-grade undo/redo system with advanced history boundary management and better performance.

### 3. CodeMirror Performance Optimization
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: High
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/CodeMirrorEditor.vue`

**Implementation**:
- Added `isVeryLargeDocument()` detection (5000+ lines or 200k+ characters)
- Enhanced `optimizeForLargeDocument()` with graduated optimization levels
- Implemented `getBatchedTextInsertion()` for breaking large operations into manageable chunks
- Added `insertLargeText()` with async batching to prevent UI blocking
- Enhanced `getPerformanceStats()` with memory usage estimation
- Improved large paste operation handling with automatic history boundaries

**Impact**: Smooth editing experience even with very large markdown documents, preventing UI freezing during large operations.

### 4. Tab Reordering with Drag-and-Drop
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: High
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/TabBar.vue`
- `src/composables/useDocuments.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Added comprehensive drag state management with visual feedback
- Implemented full drag-and-drop event handlers (`handleDragStart`, `handleDragEnd`, `handleDragOver`, `handleDrop`)
- Enhanced document composable with `reorderDocuments()` and `getDocumentIndex()` methods
- Added drag visual indicators (opacity, scale transforms, drop zone highlights)
- Prevented dragging during tab editing mode

**Impact**: Professional tab reordering experience matching modern browser tab behavior with smooth visual feedback.

### 5. Tab Overflow Management System
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: High
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/TabBar.vue`

**Implementation**:
- Added scroll control buttons (left/right arrows) with intelligent visibility
- Implemented overflow dropdown menu for tabs beyond visible area
- Added `checkTabOverflow()` for dynamic overflow detection
- Implemented smooth scrolling with `scrollLeft()` and `scrollRight()` methods
- Added `scrollActiveTabIntoView()` for automatic active tab visibility
- Created `ResizeObserver` integration for responsive overflow detection

**Impact**: Scalable tab system handling unlimited documents with professional navigation controls and responsive behavior.
