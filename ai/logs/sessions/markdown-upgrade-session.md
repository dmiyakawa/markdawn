# Markdown Upgrade Development Session

**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Type**: Development Session  
**Status**: Complete ✅

## Session Objective
Upgrade markdown processing from basic regex to comprehensive library implementation with full GitHub Flavored Markdown support.

## Work Accomplished

### 1. Markdown Library Integration
- **Installed**: marked.js v16.1.2 with TypeScript types
- **Reasoning**: Lightweight, fast, excellent GFM support, browser-optimized
- **Configuration**: Enabled line breaks and GitHub Flavored Markdown

### 2. Utility Module Creation (`src/utils/markdown.ts`)
- **`convertMarkdownToHtml()`**: Robust markdown parsing with error handling
- **`convertHtmlToMarkdown()`**: Bidirectional conversion for WYSIWYG mode
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for parsing failures
- **Features**: Headers, formatting, links, lists, code blocks, task lists, blockquotes

### 3. Application Integration (`src/App.vue`)
- Updated `renderedHtml` computed property to use marked.js
- Enhanced `handleWysiwygInput` with proper HTML-to-markdown conversion  
- Improved default content showcasing all supported features
- Maintained reactive state management patterns

### 4. Comprehensive Testing (`src/utils/markdown.test.ts`)
- **16 markdown-to-HTML tests**: All core features covered
- **6 HTML-to-markdown tests**: Bidirectional conversion verified
- **Edge cases**: Empty input, error handling, complex scenarios
- **Integration**: App.vue component tests updated and passing

### 5. Enhanced Demo Content
New default markdown showcases:
- Multiple header levels (h1-h3)
- Text formatting (bold, italic, inline code)
- Links and unordered lists  
- Fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting placeholders
- Task lists with checkboxes
- Blockquotes with helpful tips

### 6. Documentation Updates
- **`ai/architecture.md`**: Added markdown processing section
- **`ai/decisions.md`**: Documented library selection rationale  
- **`ai/next_action.md`**: Updated status and next priorities
- **`ai/tasks.md`**: Reorganized with completed work and new priorities
- **Feature log**: Created comprehensive implementation documentation

## Quality Metrics Achieved

### Testing Results
