# File Operations Development Session

**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Type**: Development Session  
**Status**: Complete ✅

## Session Objective
Implement comprehensive file operations system including import, export, save/load, status bar, and auto-save functionality.

## Work Accomplished

### 1. File Operations Utility System (`src/utils/fileOperations.ts`)

#### Import Functionality
- **`importMarkdownFile()`** with FileReader API integration
- File validation (.md/.markdown extensions, 10MB size limit)
- Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
- Promise-based asynchronous file reading

#### Export Functionality  
- **`exportMarkdownFile()`** using Blob API for downloads
- Automatic filename generation with ISO timestamps
- Clean resource management (URL cleanup after download)

#### Browser Storage System
- **`saveToLocalStorage()` / `loadFromLocalStorage()`** with structured JSON
- **`getSaveTimestamp()` / `hasSavedContent()`** metadata utilities
- **`clearLocalStorage()`** storage management
- Version-aware storage format with metadata

#### Content Analysis Tools
- **`getWordCount()`** with markdown syntax filtering
- **`getCharacterCount()`** with/without spaces calculation
- **`getLineCount()`** accurate line counting
- Smart exclusion of code blocks, links, and formatting from word counts

### 2. User Interface Integration (`src/App.vue`)

#### Enhanced Toolbar
- 5 new file operation buttons (Import, Export, Save, Load, New)
- Color-coded buttons with hover states and tooltips
- Logical grouping separated from view toggle controls
- Hidden file input for import functionality

#### Status Bar Implementation
- Real-time statistics display (words, characters, lines)
- Save status with timestamp display
- Color-coded status messages (green/red/yellow for success/error/loading)
- Last saved timestamp with locale formatting

#### Reactive State Management
- **`fileInput`** template ref for programmatic file selection
- **`lastSaved`** timestamp tracking
- **`saveStatus`** real-time operation feedback
- **`stats`** computed property for live content analysis

### 3. File Operation Methods

#### Import Process
- **`triggerFileImport()`** - Hidden input activation
- **`handleFileImport()`** - Async file processing with validation
- Real-time status feedback during import
- Input clearing for repeated selections

#### Document Management
- **`saveDocument()`** - localStorage saving with success feedback
- **`loadDocument()`** - Content restoration with timestamp recovery
- **`newDocument()`** - Confirmation dialog preventing data loss
- **`exportFile()`** - Download triggering with feedback

#### Auto-save System
- **`enableAutoSave()`** - Background saving every 30 seconds
- Non-intrusive automatic content preservation
- Silent timestamp updates without user interruption

### 4. Comprehensive Testing (`src/utils/fileOperations.test.ts`)

#### Test Categories
- **File Import Tests** (6 tests): Validation, size limits, error handling
- **Export Tests** (2 tests): Download triggering and filename handling
- **Storage Tests** (8 tests): localStorage operations, error scenarios
- **Analysis Tests** (7 tests): Content counting accuracy and edge cases

#### Testing Highlights
- Mock browser APIs (FileReader, localStorage, Blob, document)
- Error scenario testing (storage full, invalid JSON, file read errors)
- Edge case handling (empty content, large files, invalid formats)
- TypeScript type safety in all test mocks

#### Component Integration Tests
- UI element presence verification
- Button functionality testing
- Status bar display validation
- File input interaction testing
