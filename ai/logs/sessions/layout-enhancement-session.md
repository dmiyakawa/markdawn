**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Type**: UI Enhancement Session  
**Status**: Complete ✅

## Session Objective
Implement side-by-side layout with editor on left and preview on right, with proper frames around both panes.

## Work Accomplished

### 1. Layout Architecture Update (`src/App.vue`)

#### Grid-Based Layout Implementation
- **CSS Grid**: Implemented responsive grid system with `grid-cols-1 xl:grid-cols-2`
- **Responsive Design**: Single column on mobile, side-by-side on xl screens (1280px+)
- **Proper Height**: Calculated height `calc(100vh-180px)` for optimal space usage

#### Panel Design Enhancement
- **Proper Frames**: Added `border-2 border-gray-200` and `shadow-md` for visual separation
- **Header Design**: Created titled headers with `bg-gray-50 rounded-t-lg` styling
- **SVG Icons**: Added appropriate icons (edit for editor, eye for preview)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between editor and preview panes

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Panel Headers**: Each pane has a proper title with contextual icons
- **Hidden State Feedback**: Preview panel shows "(Hidden)" status when toggled off
- **Responsive Behavior**: Maintains usability on all screen sizes
- **Professional Appearance**: Enhanced visual design with frames and shadows
