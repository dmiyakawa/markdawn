## Disabled Tests Requiring Investigation

### Performance Test Issues (High Priority)

**Problem**: E2E performance tests failing due to large content handling limitations

**Location**: `tests/e2e/performance.spec.ts:17` - "should handle large markdown documents efficiently"

**Status**: Currently disabled with `test.skip()`

**Issue Description**:

- Test generates large markdown content (20+ sections, ~4000+ characters)
- Playwright's `fill()` method appears to have character limits with CodeMirror
- Only the end sections (15-20) appear in editor, beginning content is missing
- Both small (20 sections) and large (50 sections) content sizes fail

**Investigation Attempts**:

1. **JavaScript Direct Access**: Tried accessing CodeMirror view directly via `document.querySelector` and `view.dispatch()` - unsuccessful
2. **Content Size Reduction**: Reduced from 50 sections to 20 sections - still fails
3. **Test Expectation Changes**: Modified to check for end sections instead of title - still truncated
4. **Fill Method Limitations**: Confirmed `fill()` method doesn't handle large content properly in CodeMirror

**Root Cause**: Playwright's `fill()` method has limitations when setting large amounts of text in CodeMirror editors

**Potential Solutions to Investigate**:

1. Use incremental content insertion (split large content into smaller chunks)
2. Investigate CodeMirror-specific test utilities or direct API access
3. Mock large document scenarios differently (perhaps test with real file loading)
4. Use different Playwright methods like `type()` with smaller batches
5. Research CodeMirror testing best practices and official test approaches

**Re-enabling Instructions**:

1. Remove `test.skip()` from line 17 in `tests/e2e/performance.spec.ts`
2. Test will immediately reproduce the issue for debugging
3. Current test generates content and expects to find title "# Large Document Test" but only finds end sections

**Priority**: High - Performance testing is important for large document handling validation

### Image Upload Save/Load Cycle Test Issues (Medium Priority)

**Problem**: E2E image upload tests failing due to save/load functionality not working correctly

**Location**: `tests/e2e/image-upload.spec.ts:159` - "should maintain image references during save/load cycle"

**Status**: Currently disabled with `test.skip()`

**Issue Description**:

- Test sets content with "# Test Doc" and image references
- Saves content to browser storage
- Creates new document (shows "# Document 2")
- Attempts to load from browser storage
- Expected to see original "# Test Doc" but still sees "# Document 2"

**Root Cause**: Save/Load functionality integration issue

- Either save operation is not persisting correctly to localStorage
- Or load operation is not retrieving/applying the saved content correctly
- Or load operation is loading the wrong document from storage

**Investigation Needed**:

1. Test save functionality independently (check localStorage contents)
2. Test load functionality independently (verify content retrieval)
3. Check document management system for save/load workflow
4. Verify browser storage persistence across operations
5. Check if multiple documents are being saved and loaded correctly

**Re-enabling Instructions**:

1. Remove `test.skip()` from line 159 in `tests/e2e/image-upload.spec.ts`
2. Test will immediately reproduce the save/load issue
3. Content "# Test Doc" is saved but "# Document 2" persists after load

**Priority**: Medium - Important for data persistence validation but not blocking core functionality

### Performance Real-time Preview Test Issues (Medium Priority)

**Problem**: E2E performance tests showing flakiness and race conditions, particularly on Mobile Chrome

**Locations**:

- `tests/e2e/performance.spec.ts:91` - "should update preview efficiently during typing"
- `tests/e2e/performance.spec.ts:113` - "should handle rapid content changes without lag"

**Status**: Currently disabled with `test.skip()`

**Issue Description**:

- Tests fail intermittently, especially on Mobile Chrome
- Content gets jumbled/mixed up in preview (e.g., "ogy dlazer ovmps jufoxwn ro b# Welcome to Markdown Editor")
- Race conditions between editor content setting and preview synchronization
- `fill()` method combined with `keyboard.type()` causes content conflicts

**Root Cause**: Test flakiness due to:

- Timing issues between editor and preview synchronization
- Mobile Chrome browser handling of rapid content changes
- Insufficient wait times for content stabilization
- Race conditions in content setting methods

**Investigation Needed**:

1. Implement more robust waiting strategies for preview updates
2. Add content stabilization checks before assertions
3. Consider using different content setting approaches for performance tests
4. Test with longer timeouts and better synchronization
5. Investigate Mobile Chrome specific timing issues

**Re-enabling Instructions**:

1. Remove `test.skip()` from lines 91 and 113 in `tests/e2e/performance.spec.ts`
2. Tests will reproduce the flakiness issue for debugging
3. Focus on Mobile Chrome browser for consistent reproduction

**Priority**: Medium - Performance testing important but flaky tests violate reliability requirements

### Find/Replace Single Occurrence Test Flakiness (Medium Priority)

**Problem**: E2E find/replace test failing due to content setting and selection race conditions

**Location**: `tests/e2e/find-replace.spec.ts:116` - "should replace single occurrence"

**Status**: Currently disabled with `test.skip()`

**Issue Description**:

- Test attempts to set content "Hello world! This is a world of tests."
- Content gets scrambled/mixed with welcome content during setting process
- Multiple `Control+a` selections and `fill()` operations cause race conditions
- Results in content like "sts. teofld wors as iThi! rldwo# Welcome to Markdown Editor..."

**Root Cause**: CodeMirror content setting race conditions

- `Control+a` keyboard selections not completing before `fill()` operation
- CodeMirror's custom keybindings interfering with standard selection behavior
- Content mixing between original welcome text and test content
- Timing issues between keyboard events and editor state updates

**Investigation Needed**:

1. Develop more reliable content clearing approach for CodeMirror
2. Find alternative to `Control+a` + `fill()` pattern for content replacement
3. Add proper wait conditions for editor state stabilization
4. Consider using CodeMirror's direct API instead of keyboard simulation
5. Test alternative content setting methods (direct dispatching vs keyboard events)

**Re-enabling Instructions**:

1. Remove `test.skip()` from line 116 in `tests/e2e/find-replace.spec.ts`
2. Test will immediately reproduce the content scrambling issue
3. Focus on content replacement timing and method reliability

**Priority**: Medium - Find/replace functionality is important but test stability more critical than coverage

### Browser Compatibility

- Target browser versions to support
- Polyfill requirements assessment
- Mobile device optimization and testing
