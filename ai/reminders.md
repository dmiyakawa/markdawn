## Next Development Focus

**For detailed task breakdown and priorities, see [ai/tasks.md](./tasks.md)**

The next development session should focus on:
1. **Component Architecture Refactoring** - Extract panes into separate UI components
2. **Image Management Interface** - Create gallery browser and management panel
3. **Testing Expansion** - Add tests for tab pinning and keyboard navigation features

## Development Commands

### Primary Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run test:coverage` - Check coverage
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run format` - Format code

### E2E Testing Commands
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests
- `npm run test:e2e:headed` - Run E2E tests with browser visible
- `npm run test:e2e:update` - Update visual regression baselines

## Technical Approach Summary

- **Vue 3 Composition API + TypeScript**: Modern reactive UI with strict type safety
- **CodeMirror 6 integration**: Professional code editor with markdown syntax highlighting
- **Dual Editor Architecture**: Always-visible Markdown (left) and WYSIWYG (right) with bidirectional sync
- **Emacs-style Navigation**: Document-level keyboard shortcuts with browser default overrides
- **Find/Replace System**: Advanced search UI with regex, case-sensitive options fully integrated with CodeMirror
- **Information Pane**: Header-integrated statistics and save status with compact spacing
- **Flexbox Layout**: Reliable side-by-side positioning with resizable panes
- **Image Management**: localStorage-based storage with cursor-based insertion
- **Auto-save & Persistence**: 30-second intervals with content preservation across reloads
- **Testing Strategy**: 115 passing unit tests, comprehensive E2E infrastructure

## Current System Assessment

The application has evolved into a sophisticated dual-editor markdown environment with professional CodeMirror integration, WYSIWYG capabilities, and advanced features. All critical infrastructure issues have been resolved:

### System Status
- **115/115 unit tests passing** (100% success rate) with comprehensive component test coverage  
- **Professional dual-editor experience** with real-time synchronization
- **Advanced search capabilities** with regex and visual highlighting fully integrated with CodeMirror
- **Enhanced undo/redo system** with 200-entry history depth and boundary management
- **Performance optimizations** for large documents with batched operations and memory management
- **Professional tab management** with drag-and-drop reordering, overflow controls, pinning system, and keyboard navigation
- **Optimal viewport management** for long document editing
- **Preserved image references** throughout all editing workflows
- **Robust E2E testing infrastructure** with visual regression testing

The application now provides a comprehensive, professional markdown editing experience with advanced editor features ready for component architecture improvements and specialized feature development.

## Task Completion Checklist

### Before Ending Any Development Session

#### Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
- [ ] Run `npm run format` to ensure consistent formatting
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage` to verify 80% test coverage maintained
- [ ] Run `npm run test:e2e` to verify E2E tests are working

#### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update `ai/architecture.md` if any architectural decisions were made
- [ ] Update `ai/decisions.md` if any development choices were made
- [ ] Update `ai/tasks.md` with any new tasks discovered or remaining work
- [ ] Move completed tasks in `ai/tasks.md` to `ai/completed_tasks.md`
- [ ] Update `ai/reminders.md` if project status changed significantly

#### Development State
- [ ] Commit significant progress (if requested by user)
- [ ] Record what was accomplished in `ai/logs/` directory
- [ ] Ensure application is in a working state (can run `npm run dev` successfully)

#### Testing Requirements
- [ ] All new features have unit tests
- [ ] Coverage thresholds are met (80% minimum)
- [ ] All tests pass with `npm run test`
