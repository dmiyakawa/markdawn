✅ **Content Persistence Complete** - Auto-save, localStorage, content preservation across reloads
✅ **UI Enhancement Complete** - Menu bar layout, responsive design, full-screen mode, resizable panes
✅ **Advanced Editor Features Complete** - CodeMirror 6 with syntax highlighting and emacs shortcuts
✅ **Find/Replace System Complete** - Full search functionality with regex and case-sensitive options
✅ **Unit Testing Complete** - 69/69 tests passing, comprehensive coverage across components
⚠️  **E2E Testing Issues** - Playwright tests have configuration issues that need resolution

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Critical: Fix E2E Testing Infrastructure** 
   - **Resolve Playwright configuration issues** causing test runner failures
   - **Update E2E tests** to work with new CodeMirror editor selectors 
   - **Re-establish E2E test coverage** for Find/Replace functionality
   - **Verify visual regression tests** work with updated UI

2. **Complete Advanced Editor Integration**
   - **Connect Find/Replace to CodeMirror** - Currently UI-only, needs search implementation
   - **Implement live scroll synchronization** between editor and preview panes
   - **Add unit tests** for CodeMirrorEditor and FindReplace components  
   - **Optimize CodeMirror performance** for large documents

3. **Testing Expansion** 
   - Enhanced E2E test scenarios (file upload simulation, drag-and-drop testing)
   - Performance testing optimization for large documents
   - Accessibility testing and ARIA compliance improvements

4. **Image Management Interface**
   - Create image gallery browser for stored images
   - Add image management panel (view, delete, organize stored images)
   - Implement batch image operations (select multiple, bulk delete)
   - Add image insertion helper with preview and alt text editing

5. **Advanced Editor Features**
   - Live scroll synchronization between editor and preview panes
   - Multiple document tabs/workspace management
   - Document outline/table of contents generation
   - Advanced export formats (standalone HTML, styled PDF)

## Development Commands Ready
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run test:coverage` - Check coverage
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests
- `npm run test:e2e:headed` - Run E2E tests with browser visible
- `npm run test:e2e:update` - Update visual regression baselines
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run format` - Format code

## Architecture Decisions Made
- Vue 3 with Composition API, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for modern reactive UI
- **CodeMirror 6 integration** for professional editor with syntax highlighting and emacs shortcuts
- **Emacs-style keyboard shortcuts** with browser default overrides using Prec.highest()
- **Find/Replace system** positioned below menu bar with regex and case-sensitive support
- Flexbox layout system (replacing CSS Grid) for reliable side-by-side editor/preview
- marked.js for robust markdown processing with stored image reference support
- JSZip integration for complete project export (markdown + images)
- Browser localStorage for image storage and content persistence
- Comprehensive testing with 69 unit tests (E2E tests need configuration fixes)
- ESLint + Prettier with TypeScript for consistent code quality
